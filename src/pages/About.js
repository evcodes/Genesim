                    Genesim was inspire by a DNA + Latinx class at Williams College.
                    This course built the scientific foundations and historical context around DNA then proceeded
                    to show how powerful genetic code is. Since genetic code represents different illnesses, fields like
                    Computational Biology have brought incredible insights into epidemiology, oncology research, and degenerative diseases.

                    This project is an attempt to simulate a gene selection process and capture the intersection between
                    genetics, anthropology, computer science, and math/statistics. The avatars generated will have a 
                    short history snippet attached to them based on the features selected and their country of origin.

                    <p1> My name is Eddy Varela and I am a software developer with a computer science and math major, however,
                        I also love storytelling, filmmaking, and video. I am interested in how people decide which traits are
                        more favorable in terms of eye color, skin complexion, hair, nose, etc and how this plays out in their
                        lived experience. Many narratives that we have seen in the course heavily revolve around physical
                        appearance defining a personâ€™s country of origin and their lived experience.</p1>
