                    Genesim was inspire by a DNA + Latinx class at Williams College.
                    This course built the scientific foundations and historical context around DNA then proceeded
                    to show how powerful genetic code is. Computational Biology is an entire new field of research
                    that exists at the intersection of genetics, computer science, and math/statistics that focuses
                    on analyzing the human genome to find certain special insights.
                    
                    For example, much of the cancer research is  if From the basic building blocks to sequence someone's
